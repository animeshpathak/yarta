The Only_For_Inheritance.png Class diagram is meant to get the inheritance view among the classes
of the msemanagement package. The method parameters and datatypes shown in this diagram may 
be different that the original one. My eclipse plugin for class diagram has expired, so cant 
generate new inheritance diagram for classes.

ClassDiagram_DataTypes is the correct class diagram that has the datatypes and 
function parameters exactly as that in the source code.
