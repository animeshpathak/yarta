User stories regarding Yarta - Elgg collaboration

Both Alice and Bob have an account on Elgg. Only Alice uses the mobile version which also integrates Yarta.

Story 1. Alice updates her information using the mobile app. Bob sees her updates and is happy about it.
Story 2. Bob adds Alice as a friend. Alice sees that and adds back Bob as a friend, both being happy about it.
Story 3. Bob creates a group for developers. Alice joins the group. Bob sees that and is happy about it.
Story 4. Bob was already a member of Alice's group which she created using the mobile app, but deciedes to leave the group. Alice sees that.


Question 1. If there is a 1-1 mapping between users why not for groups as well? There should be one as well, since we want 4 to work.
Question 2. If something gets updated in Yarta, should the Elgg be notified instantly? I suppose not, since networking can not happen on the UI thread (e.g. Person.setWebsite) so there should be a time-based pooling of information.
